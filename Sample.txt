Mr. X has recently learnt about Fibonacci series, and told his father about it. His father being

a mathematician asked him to tell the Nth number of the Fibonacci series.

But, Mr.X told his father that it is difficult to solve the series as he is getting very large

numbers. His father being lenient made his work less and asked to tell only last two digits

of the Nth number of Fibonacci series. Please help Mr.X to find the answer

Note: 1st element of series is 1. And 2nd element of series is 1.

If last 2 digits are 03(for instance) print 3.
